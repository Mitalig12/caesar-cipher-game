A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar who used it with a shift of three (A becoming D when encrypting, and D becoming A when decrypting) to protect messages of military significance.
